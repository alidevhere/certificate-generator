to create the certificates for participants. So i created this app to automate this process. It is easy to use and simple and 
saves tons of hardwork.

After you have successfully installed the app you can follow the following steps to generate certificates from csv files.

Csv file is a file in which column values are separated by commas. Usually at the end of webinar we make attendees fill out a Google Form if you don't know how to create a Google Form then you can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhA1A5T-Zc8) or [read it here.](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6281888?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

# 2. Add appropriate headings to columns in csv file:
Now you need to give heading to each column of csv file these headings will be used as labels to arrange text on template. Save changes in csv file.
