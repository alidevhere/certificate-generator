## What's the need of it?
During panademic Student Communities are conducting online webinars and making our community strong. It is much time consuming 
to create the certificates for participants. So i created this app to automate this process. It is easy to use and simple and 
saves tons of hardwork.

# How to use it ?

After you have successfully installed the app you can follow the following steps to generate certificates from csv files.

# 1. Create .csv file:

Csv file is a file in which column values are separated by commas. Usually at the end of webinar we make attendees fill out a Google Form if you don't know how to create a Google Form then you can [watch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhA1A5T-Zc8) or [read it here.](https://support.google.com/docs/answer/6281888?co=GENIE.Platform%3DDesktop&hl=en).

# 2. Add appropriate headings to columns in csv file:
Now you need to give heading to each column of csv file these headings will be used as labels to arrange text on template. Save changes in csv file.
